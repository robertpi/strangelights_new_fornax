We had just over 50 people, mostly from the south east of England, but a few had travelled from places like Scotland, Brussels and Holland to see us. I’d like to say big thanks to all the speakers for providing interesting and thought provoking talks. So, thanks to Sadek, Matthew, Anton, Ganesh, and Duncan. Also, a big thanks to Skills Matter for providing the location, logistics, pizza and beer. Photos and video from the event should start appearing soon, in the meantime <a href="http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2009/12/skills-matter-functional-programming.html">Mike Hadlow</a> has provided this <a href="http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2009/12/skills-matter-functional-programming.html">nice run down of the day</a>.
