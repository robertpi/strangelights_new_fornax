On Friday I attended ["FSharpConf"](http://fsharpconf.com), I was pleased to see that this conference was asking attendees to support a charity [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/) and have donated some money to this charity. The organizers sited the current protests in the United States as the reason for this request, but even outside of this context I believe supporting makes [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/). I'd like thank them both for organizing this conference and supporting this cause.

I was disappointed to learn that a portion the F# community disagreed with the conference supporting [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/), their arguments mainly being that a conference should be apolitical. One of the conference organizers, [Gien](https://twitter.com/selketjah), has already written an excellent post [summarizing the arguments put to her and rebuking them](https://www.selketjah.com/no-category/2020/06/06/an-apolitical-post/).

I'm writing this post to support Gien, and the other organizers, and give my take on why it's important to support organizations like [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/).

There's a very interesting talk form Christopher Hitchens in support of paying [reparations for slavery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MNu2GNx-kQ). In it he starts by making an analogy with the case of returning the [the Elgin Marbles ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Spoils), a subject which he wrote a book on. After publishing this book, he says was subjected to "Torrent of bad faith" but "when  people begin to introduce the irrelevant the non sequitur and the generalizations ... you can tell you're onto something".

The Elgin marbles are currently on display in the British museum. They were removed from Parthenon in the period of 1801 to 1812 by the Earl of Elgin and used to decorate his private home. He was then forced to sell them to finance an expensive divorce. He sold them to the British museum, so they would go on public display, despite receive higher offers from private collectors.

Hitchens makes the argument that the statues should be returned to the Parthenon because their removal was a crime, if not in the legal sense then in the moral sense, and that crime could be at least partially repaired by their return.

His detractors principally focused there arguments along two lines: 
 
- Generalizations: "So that means we should return all artifacts from all museums to where they originally came from?" 
- Trying to justify the current situation: "The Elgin marbles are better off at the British museum because many artifacts in Parthenon, and around Athens, where damaged"
- Making the best the enemy of good: "The Elgin marbles could not be full returned as they are already damaged, so we shouldn't return them"

We can see these arguments can be easily rebuked:

- Generalization: No, this is clearly not what we're say. Artifacts should be treated on a case by case basis, introducing generalization only seeks to distract.
- Trying to justify the current situations, again seeks to distract that original act was a crime, an injustice and morally wrong.
- Making the best the enemy of good, trying to block progress by saying the ideal situation is fully obtainable then we shouldn't make any progress towards them.

The important questions to ask are: is there an injustice? is there something we can do to go some way to repairing this injustice?

Using this analogy to understand the arguments against supporting [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/), we see that:
