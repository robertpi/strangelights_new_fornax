<p>Well we're doing it again!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial">I've been running a conference "Functional Programming eXchange" in London for a few years now. The conference is run by Skills Matter and will take place on Friday 15th Mar 2013.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<font face="Arial">
<p>The idea of the conference is to bring together London's diverse functional programming communities to share ideas and war stories. Most previous talks have focus on concepts from functional programming or feedback from projects that have used functional programming. Previous talks can be seen on line:<br />
