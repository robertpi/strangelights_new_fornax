This is why I was very pleased to find &#8220;The Laundromat Caf&#233;&#8221;, a bar with a small laundry at the back. I thought this was a really neat idea, certainly makes waiting of you&#8217;re clothes to dry a lot more pleasant. If you&#8217;re in the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Copenhagen</st1:place></st1:City> area you should check it out, it&#8217;s on Elemgate 15, Norrebro.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

We're desperate to find a laundromat.  What metro stop or bus is this laundromat near?  Coffee would be nice, too.  Thanks!<br>Reallilybart@yahoo.com
