<p>Just a quick note to say the guys at <a href="http://www.intellifactory.com/">IntelliFactory</a> have created a <a href="http://fpish.net/">great little site called “FPish”</a> dedicated to Functional Programming training material and course. <a href="http://fpish.net/profile/44">My profile can be found here</a>.</p>  <p>The sites is completely written in F# using there <a href="http://www.websharper.com">WebSharper</a> development tools, it’s a great example of the sort of very dynamic websites you can create with WebSharper.</p>
