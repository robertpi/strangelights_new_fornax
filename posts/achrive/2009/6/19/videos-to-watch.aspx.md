<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US" lang="EN-US"><font size="3">So this blog has been quite lately, well it never was the most active in the world. Anyway the good news is there are lots of other good F# resources on the web at the moment. Particually Lang.NET was a great source of F# videos, I was there myself, but I’ve spoke with a few people who were, and indeed there they told me there was lots of interest in F#. <o:p /></font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US" lang="EN-US"><font size="3">A couple of videos I really liked were:<o:p /></font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US" lang="EN-US">Luke Hoban</span></strong><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US" lang="EN-US"> <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">on F# Productization</strong>: This was an interesting talk, not because it when in depth into F# the language, but because Luke gave a peak behind the scenes of how you run a major F# project - the productization.<o:p /></span></font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.langnetsymposium.com/2009/talks/25-LukeHoban-FSharpProductization.html"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US" lang="EN-US"><font size="3">http://www.langnetsymposium.com/2009/talks/25-LukeHoban-FSharpProductization.html</font></span></a><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US" lang="EN-US"><o:p /></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US" lang="EN-US">Amanda Laucher on F# Concurrency:</span></strong><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US" lang="EN-US"> This a very interesting talk from the charismatic Amanda “Pandamonial” Laucher. Amanda presents a case study of a real world project she’s been working on in the insurance domain. Her mission was to use the concurrency features of F# speed up the companies risk calculations, and the results she achieved are quite amazing. She presents what I see as very compelling reasons for using F#:<o:p /></span></font></p>

<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US" lang="EN-US"><font size="3">Of course I can’t not mention the “Language Oriented Programming in F#” talk by Roger Castillo at Lang.net’s sister event “DslDevCon”. I was briefly involved with the organization of this talk, though to be fair it was Chance Coble and Roger who did the hard work. I was hoping to make it to the event to co-present the talk, but alas, Paris is a long way from Seattle:<o:p /></font></span></p>

<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US" lang="EN-US"><font size="3">Other note worthy videos are <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Charles/Luke-Hoban-Latest-version-of-F-Released-Whats-the-story-Whats-next/">Luke Hoban on F#</a>, who makes some very interesting points about how F# programming differs from programming in C#. I like this video because it builds on what <a href="http://lorgonblog.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!701679AD17B6D310!511.entry">Brian McNamara said in this blog post</a>.</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US" lang="EN-US"><font size="3">Phil Trelford, did <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/phil-trelford-f-introduction">a nice session</a> for the skillsmatter.com guys and gals, and also <a href="http://cs.hubfs.net/forums/thread/10999.aspx">has another planned</a>.</font></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US" lang="EN-US"><font size="3">There’s also this <a href="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-webcast-functional.aspx">series</a> <a href="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-webcast-dotnet.aspx">of</a> 4 <a href="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-webcast-async.aspx">web</a> <a href="http://tomasp.net/articles/fsharp-webcast-objects.aspx">casts</a> from Tomáš Petříček, which to be honest I haven’t had chance to watch yet, but knowing Tomas’ work I’m sure they’ll be very high quality. </font></span></p>

Hi Robert, thanks for posting this list. This far, Luke's have been my favorite.  Although, I had completely missed out on Roger Castillo's Language Oriented Programming in F# talk. I'll be sure to watch it this weekend.  I've been dieing for more content with advanced topics.
