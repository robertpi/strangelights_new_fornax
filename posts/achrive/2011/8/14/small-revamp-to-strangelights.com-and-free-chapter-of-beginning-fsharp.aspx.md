<p>I’ve been neglecting strangelights.com a bit lately, mainly due to lack of time. So, today I finally got round to fixing a few things that had been bugging me and clean away some of the old and out of data material, especially in the F# resources section. I’ve also upgraded to the latest version of subtext as a few people have reports some minor bugs with the comments system to me, so hopefully this will fix them.</p>  <p>To celebrate this revamp I’m giving away chapter 3 of my book “Beginning F#”. This is the chapter that describes how functional programming in F# works, so should hopefully go a long way to get you started programming in F#. <a href="/fsharp/downloads/BeginningFSharp_ch03.pdf">Download the pdf</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=1Xxk4I3E8Obe88k33WlIVN7fbPBlgGlcA9wgzE2IsmboB9A9pPRZ9djQAyV8_&amp;hl=en_US">view in google docs</a>. Enjoy. All the examples from the book have always been available online and <a href="http://bfs.codeplex.com/">can be found on codeplex</a>.</p>
