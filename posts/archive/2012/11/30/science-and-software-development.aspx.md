<p>Today I gave a talk ”Science and Software Development” at the <a href="http://weactuallybuildstuff.com/">weactuallybuildstuff.com</a>. The talk was largely inspired by Ben Goldacre’s “Bad Science” <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/series/badscience">column</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bad-Science-Ben-Goldacre/dp/000728487X">book</a> and try to apply some of the ideas relating to the use and abuse of evidence in the software industry. In the talk I tried to build a case for why the software industry might by to pay more attention to scientific techniques, such as “Randomized Controlled Trails”, by talking about availability bias, Confirmation Bias, the placebo effect and overconfidence.
