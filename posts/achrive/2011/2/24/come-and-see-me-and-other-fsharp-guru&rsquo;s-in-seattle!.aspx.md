<p>I’m off to Seattle for the MVP summit very soon. I’ve arranged to meet with fellow F# fan’s <a href="http://lifeofadev.blogspot.com/">Cameron Frederick</a> and <a href="http://richardminerich.com/">Richard Minerich</a> at the <a href="http://www.taphousegrill.com/beer.html">Tap House Bar</a> in Belleveue at 3:30pm on Sunday. Happy hour start at 3:30pm, so it should  be lots of fun. The address of the bar is <a href="http://local.google.fr/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=550+106th+Avenue+NE,+bellevue&amp;aq=t&amp;sll=46.75984,1.738281&amp;sspn=12.239987,33.815918&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=550+106th+Ave+NE,+Bellevue,+King,+Washington+98004,+United+States&amp;z=16">550 106th Avenue NE, Bellevue</a>, which is near the hotels for the Summit.
