<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">I note on in a <a href="http://strangelights.com/blog/archive/2009/03/19/1635.aspx">previous blog post</a> that I’ve started creating an <a href="http://github.com/robertpi/fscollintelli/tree/master">open source project for manipulating data</a>. For the moment it’s mainly based around the idea of “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence">Collective Intelligence</a>”, but I hope to draw on influences from other sources as it evolves. I’ve reorganised the source so it’s a bit clearer and added some other concepts, notably a tool for accessing books from “<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page">Project Guttenberg</a>” and the work I did on generic algorithms.</font></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">For the moment it’s licensed under GPLv2. I’m not a licensing expert but I believe this gives protection to the source while allowing it to remain open. If you need it under different licensing terms, contact me.</font></p>
