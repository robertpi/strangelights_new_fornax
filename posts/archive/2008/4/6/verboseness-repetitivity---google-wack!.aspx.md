<p>I found a <a href="http://www.googlewhack.com/">google wack</a>! </p>
<p>Entering: <font face="Arial">verboseness repetitivity</font></p>
<p>Gives one site: <font face="Arial"><a href="http://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/SPECIALIST/Projects/lexicon/2007/release/LEX/LRNOM">http://lexsrv3.nlm.nih.gov/SPECIALIST/Projects/lexicon/2007/release/LEX/LRNOM</a></font></p>
<p><img alt="" src="/blog/photos/googlewack.jpg" /></p>
<p>Suprising wack too since you'd think the two words go together. Interesting lexicon project too.</p>
<p>I wasn't looking for one just using google to check a spelling.</p>
