<p>I probably should have posted this a bit earlier but here goes anyway: I will be presenting at Microsoft TechDays Paris, my talk will be co-presented with Don Syme and we'll be talking about parallelism and F#. Don will also be presenting an introduction to F#. Don's talk is at 14:30 and our joint talk is at 17:30.</p>
<p>Sign up for TechDays here:<br />
