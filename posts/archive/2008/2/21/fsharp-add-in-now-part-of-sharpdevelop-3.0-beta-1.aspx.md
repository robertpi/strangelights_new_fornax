<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><font face="Calibri" size="3">Lately I’ve been working on integrating F# into the open source IDE <a href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/">SharpDevelop</a>. I’m pleased to announce that this has been released as part of <a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/forums/p/7381/20958.aspx#20958">SharpDevelop 3.0 beta 1</a>. See the screen shots below to get an idea of the look and feel:</font></p>

The integration is still far from finished, but I’ve been “dogfooding” away and feel I’m making pogress, expect to see more improvements in beta2!</span>

This is a very worthwhile thing to do.  My thanks and respect for the time and effort you've taken to do this.<br /><br />I don't currently use SharpDevelop very often, though it has some tools which are important (i.e. language conversion).  It is on the outskirts of my thinking though, it seems to me that Boo could be worth exploring!<br /><br />In the long term how will the project be maintained?

thank you <b>very</b> much.

In the long term the project will be maintain by me and the rest of the SharpDevelop devs, indeed there's still quite a lot of work to do to make it really usable, but I'm progressing slowly but surely.<br /><br />If anyone else is interested in volunteering the help would certainly be welcome.
