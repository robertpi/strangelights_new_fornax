<P>I'll be noting all f# updates in my blog, so you can just subscribe to the "F# updates" feed and be automatically informed of any new F# updates.</P>
<P>On a related note I've added 5 new tutorals to the f sharp site. A summary of these is available <A href="http://www.strangelights.com/FSharp/tut1-intro.aspx">here</A>.</P>
